It is a three people group project from August 2022 to September 2022. All art materials are from an online database
(www.aigei.com). Most of the codes are original, and some codes were adjusted from the sample codes
given by Professor Bill Nace in class.

I volunteered to be a team leader, conceive the game, clarify the requirements, recruit team members, organize
communication, design most of the code, and be responsible for integration and post-integration
debugging.During the 12th year, although I was busy with homework and university applications, whenever I
had time, I picked up the original code, added functions to it, tested the code, and further improved an
improved the functions in the card game.


The project is a turn-based 2D video game. There are six characters in the game and they have different
attributes. In each level, the player gets to choose one character to enter the game. Inside the game, the player
can choose cards as the characterâ€™s attack methods. After each round in the level, the player can again choose a
card to use. If the player passes through all the three rounds, the player wins the game. Otherwise, if the player
dies in the round, the player will be popped out from this level.
