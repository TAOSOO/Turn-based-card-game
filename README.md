This is a group project in a program contributed by three prople including me, as a group leader. Since I had further improved this project after the program, 
it is re-uploaded.
All images included are sources online. The some sound tracks were provided 
by the professor Bill Nace and some were downloaded from online, and part of the code were sample code of the professor.


The project is a turn-based 2D video game. There are six characters in the game and they have different
attributes. In each level, the player gets to choose one character to enter the game. Inside the game, the player
can choose cards as the characterâ€™s attack methods. After each round in the level, the player can again choose a
card to use. If the player passes through all the three rounds, the player wins the game. Otherwise, if the player
dies in the round, the player will be popped out from this level.
